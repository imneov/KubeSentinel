# KubeSentinel

KubeSentinel can observe changes to CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and provide notification capabilities.  
In other words, KubeSentinel has the ability to:  
- Monitor Custom Resources (objects created from CRDs)
- Detect changes made to those custom resources
- Send notifications when changes occur
